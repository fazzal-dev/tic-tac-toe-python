# tic-tac-toe-python

This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 board, where two players take turns placing their respective markers (X or O) in empty cells until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw. The implementation uses Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and provides a user-friendly command-line interface for playing the game.
